The repo contains two main folders, an faq, a cheatcheet, the spec, and a main readme

Doing a depth first search on the repo starting from the readme



- README.md (main folder)
Contains mvps for each day 


LS8-spec.md
Description of each instruction. How the code should work on a more
granular level

LS8-cheatsheet.md
Not 100% sure yet. I see operations, followed by binary, followed by 
two rows of hex for the first thing labeled ALU ops.
Maybe operation, place in memory, and... not sure about the hex

FAQ.md
faq about computers and emulators. Some questions specifically about the project

.gitignore
git-ignore it :awesome:


-----ls8-----
README.md
An outline of implimenting the 8 bit emulator. It is split into steps, but not
by day. The split by day is in the main readme for the repo

ls8.py
Looks like this is where we're going to be running everything from

cpu.py
the code for our cpu. This should contain everything necessary to run our
emulator from. This is our 'piano'

-examples- (subfolder)
These 9 files contain the programs to be run with our cpu.
These are the 'scrolls with holes in them'. I need to remember what those are called.
Pop used to have a ton of them for playing ragtime music.

-----asm-----
Alright, a lot of node.js stuff in this folder. Not eeeeeven going to touch this
